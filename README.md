# CareerMate: AI-Powered Multilingual Career Guidance System

**An intelligent career counselor that understands you, in your language**

---

## Overview

CareerMate is an AI-driven career guidance platform that uses NLP, speech-to-text, and LLMs to provide personalized career recommendations. The system understands user context, remembers preferences, and delivers multilingual support—making career guidance accessible to everyone, regardless of language barrier.

**Key Achievement:** Deployed with 95% user satisfaction across 150+ students. Supports 8+ languages with real-time guidance.

---

## Problem Statement

Career guidance is often:
- Expensive and inaccessible to students from underserved backgrounds
- Limited to English-speaking populations
- One-size-fits-all without personalization
- Disconnected from real job market data

CareerMate addresses these gaps by making AI-powered career counseling available to anyone, anywhere, in their native language.

## Solution Architecture

### Core Components
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)** - Converts user speech into text using OpenAI Whisper
- **NLP Engine** - Understands user intent, skills, interests, and goals
- **LLM Integration** - GPT-4 for personalized career recommendations
- **Multilingual Translation** - Google Translate API for 8+ languages
- **User Profile Builder** - Tracks skills, interests, education, experience
- **Job Recommendation Engine** - Matches user profile to real job listings
- **Conversational Memory** - Remembers context across sessions

### Workflow
1. User speaks/types query in native language
2. STT converts speech to text
3. Translate to English for processing
4. NLP extracts user intent and context
5. Profile builder updates user data
6. LLM generates career recommendations
7. Job matching engine finds relevant positions
8. Translate response back to user's language
9. TTS (optional) converts response to speech
10. System logs interaction for future reference
